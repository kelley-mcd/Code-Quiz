We were tasked with creating a start page to where the user would be able to click and immediatly start the quiz and be prompted with the questions. 

As the user continued with the quiz, there would be a timer counting from 0-15 showing the user that this is a timed quiz and that once the time runs out they are no longer able to continue.

Once the user has completed the quiz, answering all the questions, the user is them prompted with the final score of the quiz.
